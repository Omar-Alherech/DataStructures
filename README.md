"# DataStructures" 

**LinkedLists**
Implementation of a node, and Singly Linked List structure intended to be used to build a Doubly-LinkedList.  
Each node has it's own generic type data variable, a Node Linked as a head, and a Node linked as a tail. This allows  
all the nodes in the Doubly-LinkedList to be connected, and allows for the ability to traverse back and forth, an  
ability a singly-linkedList does not have.  

**Queue**
The following class Queue is an implementation of the  
built in java class Queue. It represents a data structure  
that allows elements to be inserted at the end of the queue,  
and removed from the beginning, using a linked list as the underlying data structure.
