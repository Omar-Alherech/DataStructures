"# DataStructures" 

**LinkedLists**
Implementation of a node, and Singly Linked List structure intended to be used to build a Doubly-LinkedList.  
Each node has it's own generic type data variable, a Node Linked as a head, and a Node linked as a tail. This allows  
all the nodes in the Doubly-LinkedList to be connected, and allows for the ability to traverse back and forth, an  
ability a singly-linkedList does not have.
